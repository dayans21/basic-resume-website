  <h1> Hi I'm Dayana Soria</h1>
  <p>
    I have a passion for building and organizing, which naturally led me to front-end 
    development and project management, where I design user-friendly interfaces and 
    lead projects from ideation to execution. Growing up in New York City as an
    Ecuadorian and a proud Latina in STEM, I’ve experienced firsthand the importance 
    of representation in tech and strive to carve out space for people like me. 
    As the youngest of three, I grew up watching and learning from my older siblings 
    while adding my own twist to things, and I now bring that same curiosity and 
    adaptability into my work
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of coding and project management, I love expressing myself through singing 
    and acting, finding excitement and creativity in performing, which carries into all 
    aspects of my life. I’ve also developed a deep love for reading, especially fantasy 
    books—there’s something magical about getting lost in different worlds filled with 
    adventure, imagination, and the occasional dragon. Whether on stage, behind a screen, 
    or immersed in a novel, I thrive on bringing ideas to life in ways that feel seamless,
    engaging, and meaningful.
